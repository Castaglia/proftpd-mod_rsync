Environment variables to set:

  RSYNC_MODULE_NAME
  RSYNC_MODULE_PATH
  RSYNC_HOST_ADDR (client IP addr)
  RSYNC_HOST_NAME (client DNS name)
  RSYNC_USER_NAME (empty if anonymous)
  RSYNC_PID (unique transfer number)
  RSYNC_REQUEST
  RSYNC_ARG#

Will need to link with libcrypto (OpenSSL) in order to get MD4 hash algos,
if we are doing authentication ourselves.  Whee.  (Maybe only support
anon rsync, or auth'd rsync over ssh.  No auth'd rsync over non-ssh?)

Will need to link to libpopt, in order to provide feature parity with
the rsync command-line options.

To handle rsync-over-ssh, mod_rsync would need to see if mod_sftp is
present/loaded _at startup_.  If so, need to register an 'exec' channel
handler/listener with mod_sftp, to handle the exec requests for executing
rsync.

The librsync library can help with some of this, I think...

  rsync-<version>/csprotocol.txt is helpful

Should mod_rsync support rsync over SSL/TLS, in addition to SSH?  (Does anyone
even use rsync over SSL/TLS?)
